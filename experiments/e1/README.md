### Experiment 1

This experiment looks at bitcoin data, with a preliminary exploration to highlight potential strategies for model training, validation, and integration with the Taoshi ecosystem. In this work we highlight a number of potentially valuable indicators and propose a technique to curate an ensemble of models which is capable of achieving high quality predictions against bitcoin.

Target Objectives:
1. Data produrement and identification of pertinent timeseries
2. Metrics of success, both current and proposed
3. Baseline model (null model)
4. Indicators based functionality
5. Optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning - results
6. Integration with Taoshi system and testing
