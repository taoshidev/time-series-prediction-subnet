# Contributor Manual

We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level. As an open-source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors. We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

> Tip for new contributors: Take a look at [GitHub's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for helpful information on working with GitHub.

## Types of contributions

There are lots of ways to contribute to TSPS.

Maintaining TSPS requires writing Python, understanding the Bittensor ecosystem and libraries, and testing locally and on the test net.

Help writing docs and catching typos and errors is always welcome.

You can also get involved by leaving feedback on [issues](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/issues) or reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/pulls) by other contributors.

We encourage you to:

- Open an issue to inform us of bugs in TSPS, documentation you found unclear, or other issues you encountered.
- [Look at existing issues](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/issues) to find ways to contribute.
- Make a pull request (PR) to address an open issue or to fix obvious problems. Read more about making a PR in [GitHubâ€™s docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
- [Review existing PRs](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/pulls) to help us merge contributions sooner.

## About this repo

Thir repo contains the Prediction Subnet code that powers Subnet 8 on [Bittensor](bittensor.com/).

We strongly recommend that you:

- First run [Running Subnet Locally](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/blob/main/docs/running_locally.md).
- Then run [Running on the Testnet](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet/blob/main/docs/running_on_testnet.md).

Your incentive mechanisms running on the mainnet are open to anyone. They emit real TAO. Creating these mechanisms incurs a `lock_cost` in TAO.

DANGER

Do not expose your private keys.
Only use your testnet wallet.
Do not reuse the password of your mainnet wallet.
Make sure your incentive mechanism is resistant to abuse.
