## About this repo

Thir repo contains the Prediction Subnet code that powers Subnet 8 on [Bittensor](bittensor.com/).

We strongly recommend that you:

- First run Running Subnet Locally.
- Then run Running on the Testnet.

Your incentive mechanisms running on the mainnet are open to anyone. They emit real TAO. Creating these mechanisms incur a lock_cost in TAO.

DANGER

Do not expose your private keys.
Only use your testnet wallet.
Do not reuse the password of your mainnet wallet.
Make sure your incentive mechanism is resistant to abuse.
